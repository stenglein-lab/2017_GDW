### 16S

The [16S](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/16S_ribosomal_RNA) ribosomal RNA gene is present in all bacterial and archaeal genomes.  This gene is sufficiently conserved that primers that anneal to conserved regions of the gene will amplify essentially any prokaryotic 16S rRNA gene.  These PCR products (amplicons) can be sequenced to provide a survey of microbial diversity in a sample.

### Adapter

Most NGS instruments require that adapters of known sequence be added to the 2 ends of dsDNA molecules that will be sequenced on the instrument.  Adapters are added in a variety of ways to starting nucleic acid molecules during library preparation.  Adapters serve multiple purposes. For instance in Illumina sequencing, adapters allow molecules to anneal to flow cells and be amplified into a clonal cluster. Adapters often contain index sequences (barcodes) that allow samples to be multiplexed.  

### Amplicon sequencing

A type of NGS in which PCR products (amplicons) are sequenced.  16S sequencing is one type of amplicon sequencing.  This is in contrast to shotgun sequencing, where libraries consist of complex populations of materials that derive randomly from the starting nucleic acids.

### Assemble

NGS typically produces reads that are shorter than the nucleic acids from which they derive.  Assembly is the process by which these short reads are stiched together to attempt to recreate the startng nucleic acid sequence.
