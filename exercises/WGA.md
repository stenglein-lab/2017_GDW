## Whole Genome Alignment Tutorial
Finally, a break from the command line!
There are two parts to this tutorial
- First, we will use Geneious to both view and perform whole genome alignments in several microorganisms
- Second, an example of using [COGE](www.genomeevolution.org/coge) for various comparative genomics analyses.

# Part 1:  WGA in Geneious
Here, we are going to download, align, and explore mitochondrial genomes from various felids.
- open Geneious
- Select File -> New -> Folder and let's call it "WGA_PRACTICE"
- Select the NCBI Genome database on the left
- Search for Felidae[orgn]
- Drag and drop only the mitochondrial genomes into the folder "WGA_PRACTICE"
- Select the mitochondrial genomes in our folder, and click the "Download" button
